Project Directory
=================

This directory maps to the guest's ```/srv``` directory.


Drupal files-directory permissions
----------------------------------

The vagrant shared-folder is configured to use the user ```vagrant```, the    
group ```www-data```, and the file/dir permissions ```775```, so they are
writable by the local user, and by the web server.
